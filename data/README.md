# About .txt files

Each file contains ‘measurement’ of given quantities at given points on the mesh. Points are identically numbered as in the project guidelines (pdf file in general folder in the drive). The information is given in the following order:

Pt number (from 1 to 18)
X coordinate of pt
Y coodrinate of pt
Z coordinate of pt
Dynamic pressure
Absolute pressure
Total pressure
Static temperature
Total temperature
Volume fraction of phase 1

The end of the file name denotes the time-step at which quantities where measured.
